Change I2876c6a8: Copybit: Fix for source x and y calculation.
(http://review.cyanogenmod.com/#change,12727)
	The x and y coordinates are derived properly from clip and dest rect with this fix.

	- Even if rotation is involved, we need to start reading from the same point.
	- Do scaling operation on the delta, and then add the source left and top values.
	- If we scale the result of addition, we will not be reading source correctly.

	CRs-fixed: 324782
