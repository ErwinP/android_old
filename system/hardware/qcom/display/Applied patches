Arne Coucheron's Change I2876c6a8: Copybit: Fix for source x and y calculation.
	http://review.cyanogenmod.com/#change,12727

	The x and y coordinates are derived properly from clip and dest rect with this fix.
	- Even if rotation is involved, we need to start reading from the same point.
	- Do scaling operation on the delta, and then add the source left and top values.
	- If we scale the result of addition, we will not be reading source correctly.
	CRs-fixed: 324782
